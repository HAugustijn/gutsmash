gutSMASH - A new approach to functionally profile the human microbiome for specialized primary metabolic gene clusters
======================================================================================================================

Anaerobic bacteria in the gut and they are responsible for the synthesis and transformation of diverse molecules involved in host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, that ultimately derive host phenotypes. The pathways encoding the production of these molecules belong to a specialized primary metabolism and are often physically clustered in the genome, in regions also known as metabolic gene clusters (MGCs).

gutSMASH is a tool that has been developed to fulfil the need of systematically evaluating the metabolic potential of these bacteria by predicting both known and novel anaerobic MGCs from the gut microbiome. The gutSMASH detection rules have been validated using a training set presented in our main publication.

Altogether, this new software provides a comprehensive toolkit to functionally characterize anaerobic bacterial genomes by not only predicting MGCs of known functions but also novel MGCs that may represent good candidates for further experimental characterization.

This repository is used to port gutSMASH to be compatible with Python 3, along
with mayor restructuring and code cleanup efforts. It is not feature-compatible
with previous antiSMASH versions for now, and certainly is not
production-quality code.

Development & Funding
---------------------

The development of gutSMASH is collaboration between the Bioinformatics Department at 
Wageningen University and Research and the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford University. This work has also been possible thanks to the technical support the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability provided.
